;; Exercise 3.1.  An accumulator is a procedure that is called
;; repeatedly with a single numeric argument and accumulates its
;; arguments into a sum. Each time it is called, it returns the
;; currently accumulated sum. Write a procedure make-accumulator that
;; generates accumulators, each maintaining an independent sum. The
;; input to make-accumulator should specify the initial value of the
;; sum; for example

;; (define A (make-accumulator 5))
;; (A 10)
;; 15
;; (A 10)
;; 25

;; -------------------------------------------------------------------

(define (make-accumulator amount)
  (lambda (more)
    (set! amount (+ more amount))
    amount))
