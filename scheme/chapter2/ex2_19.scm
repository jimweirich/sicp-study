;; Exercise 2.19.  Consider the change-counting program of section
;; 1.2.2. It would be nice to be able to easily change the currency
;; used by the program, so that we could compute the number of ways to
;; change a British pound, for example. As the program is written, the
;; knowledge of the currency is distributed partly into the procedure
;; first-denomination and partly into the procedure count-change
;; (which knows that there are five kinds of U.S. coins). It would be
;; nicer to be able to supply a list of coins to be used for making
;; change.
;;
;; We want to rewrite the procedure cc so that its second argument is
;; a list of the values of the coins to use rather than an integer
;; specifying which coins to use. We could then have lists that
;; defined each kind of currency:
;;
;; (define us-coins (list 50 25 10 5 1))
;; (define uk-coins (list 100 50 20 10 5 2 1 0.5))
;;
;; We could then call cc as follows:
;;
;; (cc 100 us-coins)
;; 292
;;
;; To do this will require changing the program cc somewhat. It will
;; still have the same form, but it will access its second argument
;; differently, as follows:
;;
;; (define (cc amount coin-values)
;;   (cond ((= amount 0) 1)
;;         ((or (< amount 0) (no-more? coin-values)) 0)
;;         (else
;;          (+ (cc amount
;;                 (except-first-denomination coin-values))
;;             (cc (- amount
;;                    (first-denomination coin-values))
;;                 coin-values)))))
;;
;; Define the procedures first-denomination,
;; except-first-denomination, and no-more? in terms of primitive
;; operations on list structures. Does the order of the list
;; coin-values affect the answer produced by cc? Why or why not?

;; ANSWER ------------------------------------------------------------

(define us-coins (reverse (list 50 25 10 5 1)))
(define uk-coins (list 100 50 20 10 5 2 1 0.5))

(define (cc amount coin-values)
  (define (first-denomination coins) (car coins))
  (define (except-first-denomination coins) (cdr coins))
  (define (no-more? coins) (null? coins))
  (cond ((= amount 0) 1)
        ((or (< amount 0) (no-more? coin-values)) 0)
        (else
         (+ (cc amount
                (except-first-denomination coin-values))
            (cc (- amount
                   (first-denomination coin-values))
                coin-values)))))

;; Does the order of the list coin-values affect the answer produced

;; No, the order doesn't seem to matter.  We take all combinations
;; eventually.  Changing the order of the coins the in list just
;; changes the order we count them, not the count itself.
