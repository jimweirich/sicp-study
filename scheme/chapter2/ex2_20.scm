;; Exercise 2.20.  The procedures +, *, and list take arbitrary
;; numbers of arguments. One way to define such procedures is to use
;; define with dotted-tail notation. In a procedure definition, a
;; parameter list that has a dot before the last parameter name
;; indicates that, when the procedure is called, the initial
;; parameters (if any) will have as values the initial arguments, as
;; usual, but the final parameter's value will be a list of any
;; remaining arguments. For instance, given the definition

;; (define (f x y . z) <body>)

;; the procedure f can be called with two or more arguments. If we
;; evaluate

;; (f 1 2 3 4 5 6)

;; then in the body of f, x will be 1, y will be 2, and z will be the
;; list (3 4 5 6). Given the definition

;; (define (g . w) <body>)

;; the procedure g can be called with zero or more arguments. If we
;; evaluate

;; (g 1 2 3 4 5 6)

;; then in the body of g, w will be the list (1 2 3 4 5 6).11

;; Use this notation to write a procedure same-parity that takes one
;; or more integers and returns a list of all the arguments that have
;; the same even-odd parity as the first argument. For example,

;; (same-parity 1 2 3 4 5 6 7)
;; (1 3 5 7)

;; (same-parity 2 3 4 5 6 7)
;; (2 4 6)

;; ANSWER ------------------------------------------------------------

(define (same-parity sample . rest)
  (let ((m (remainder sample 2)))
    (define (choose rest result)
      (cond ((null? rest) result)
            ((= m (remainder (car rest) 2))
             (choose (cdr rest) (cons (car rest) result)))
            (else
             (choose (cdr rest) result))))
    (reverse (choose rest (list sample)))))
