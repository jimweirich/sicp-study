;; SICP 2.70

;; Exercise 2.70.  The following eight-symbol alphabet with associated
;; relative frequencies was designed to efficiently encode the lyrics
;; of 1950s rock songs. (Note that the ``symbols'' of an ``alphabet''
;; need not be individual letters.)

;; A    2   NA  16
;; BOOM 1   SHA  3
;; GET  2   YIP  9
;; JOB  2   WAH  1

;; Use generate-huffman-tree (exercise 2.69) to generate a
;; corresponding Huffman tree, and use encode (exercise 2.68) to
;; encode the following message:

;; Get a job
;; Sha na na na na na na na na
;; Get a job
;; Sha na na na na na na na na
;; Wah yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip yip
;; Sha boom

;; How many bits are required for the encoding? What is the smallest
;; number of bits that would be needed to encode this song if we used
;; a fixed-length code for the eight-symbol alphabet?

;; ANSWER ------------------------------------------------------------

;; See ex2_69.scm.  I used the data from this problem for
;; demonstration in the previous problem.
