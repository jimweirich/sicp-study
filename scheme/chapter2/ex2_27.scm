;; SICP 2.27

;; Exercise 2.27.  Modify your reverse procedure of exercise 2.18 to
;; produce a deep-reverse procedure that takes a list as argument and
;; returns as its value the list with its elements reversed and with
;; all sublists deep-reversed as well. For example,

;; (define x (list (list 1 2) (list 3 4)))

;; x
;; ((1 2) (3 4))

;; (reverse x)
;; ((3 4) (1 2))

;; (deep-reverse x)
;; ((4 3) (2 1))

;; ANSWER ------------------------------------------------------------

(define (deep-reverse items)
  (define (loop items result)
    (cond ((null? items) result)
          ((not (pair? items)) items)
          (else (loop (cdr items)
                      (cons (deep-reverse (car items)) result)))))
  (loop items ()))
